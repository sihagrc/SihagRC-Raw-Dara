The red dwarf honey bee (Apis florea F.) faces the threat of extirpation in Northwest India

Material and Methods
     I conducted this study at the main campus (in an area of about 9 km2) of CCS Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar (Haryana, India). In this region, honey bees release swarms in February-March, from mid May to August is the dearth period62 and August to September also mark the period of insecticide sprays on the cotton crop. From November to February is the period of pollen and nectar flow and buildup of colonies62. In the study area, the red dwarf honey bee makes nests in the hedges and the bushes along the roads and the water channels. The colonies of this honey bee make local migrations and keep visiting the flowers of several crops that are grown in this region. 
Survey of the number of colonies of the red dwarf honey bee
     To make surveys on the number of colonies of the red dwarf honey bee (Apis florea F.) in the study area, I counted colonies of this honey bee in the last week of each month and on sunny days, thus making 12 monthly observations in a study year. I counted all the colonies in the entire study area present in the hedges alongside the roads/water channels while moving in a straight line from one end to the other end of the road/water channel. I repeated the surveys at three year intervals from 1984 to 2011 thus making 10 observation years. Thus, in total, I made 120 observations on the colony number of this honey bee during the entire period of this study (12 months × 10 years) (Table 1). 
Survey of the foraging populations of the red dwarf honey bee
      I recorded the foraging populations of the red dwarf honey bee on two crops viz. a winter crop, Raya (Brassica juncea Czern & Coss) (Figure 4) and an early summer crop, carrot (Daucus carota L.) (Figure 5). Both these crops are grown for seed production at the Research Farm of Haryana Agricultural University. In this region, Raya comes in blooms during winter months (December through mid-February) whereas carrot flowers in early summer (March/April). 
          I selected randomly five plots of 1×1 m2 size in the crop area during the peak flowering of each crop and recorded the observations on sunny days at noon on the Raya plots and at 1100h on the Carrot plots. I recorded the instant number of foraging bees present in 1×1m2 areas on five plots and repeated at weekly intervals on five days (total 5×5=25 observations). I repeated these observations at three year intervals from 1984 to 2011 (Table 2).
The statistical analysis 
       I used OPSTAT65 for testing the statistical significance of data. For testing the effect of years and months on the number of colonies, I processed the data for ‘One Factor Analysis’66. Likewise, for the effect of years and plots on the number of foragers, I processed the data for ‘Two Factor Analysis’67. However, for the comparison of ‘number of foragers on Raya and Carrot plots’ I processed the data for ‘One Factor Analysis’66. 
       In all these cases, I used the Duncan Multiple Range Test as a post hoc test for making comparisons between the individual means. I derived yearly means of colony numbers from the 12 monthly observations and the monthly means from the 10 yearly observations. Likewise, for making comparison between means of foragers in different years, I derived the latter from 25 observations (5 plots × each plot having 5 observations). For making comparison between means of foragers in different plots, I derived the latter from 50 observations (10 years × 5 observations in each plot). I derived C.D. (critical difference) for each analysis and calculated differences between individual means of a parameter. If the difference between any two means was greater than the calculated value of C.D., I considered this difference as statistically significant i.e. the two means differed significantly65-69. 
       To ascertain the degree of relationship between colony numbers and the forager numbers, I derived correlations between these parameters and tested these with simple T-test 68.
